### 1. Weekly Reflection
**What did I do:**
- Read *ImpliCity*
- Read Thesis by Weixiao

---

### 2. Questions
**Regarding *ImpliCity*:**
- Geodelta wants to measure using this mesh; would it be better to use explicit (since there are known true locations) or implicit methods?
- How does this paper connect to the adaptive mesh refinement approach?

**Regarding Thesis by Weixiao:**
- The thesis assumes that a mesh already exists, while our goal is to create one.
- What is the benefit of over-segmentation? -> preproccesing step to extract features for final semantic segmentation

**Regarding Implicit Representations:**
- Do we sample the field not only in the z-direction (as in *ImpliCity*), but in x, y, z directions? For hierarchical refinement

**Regarding Explicit Representations:**
- Could you clarify what you mean by "simplification problem"?

**Segmentation Framework Discussion:**
- *"If what you're interested in is the SA network, maybe it should be in there."*
- I likely want to use the SA network but need to determine if it is the best option or if another segmentation framework would be better.
- The focus is on finding the best way to **use** segmentation. Could this be a valid subquestion?

### 3. Showing the Oblique Imagery Data
- Show the data provided by Geodelta.

---

### 4. Planning for the Coming 2 Weeks
- Start coding in C#.
- Narrow down on Objectives / Research questions
- Christmas break

---

### 5. Setting Up Zotero Sync & GitHub Access
- Add Ken to Zotero Group, so he can access/see my saved literature
- Add him to the thesis Github repository so he can see meetings/code

---

### 6. Upcoming Deadlines
- No official deadlines until P2

---

### 7. Next Meeting
- Schedule and plan for the next session.

### 8. Recap
