### 1 Weekly Reflection
1. What did I do
- Read ImpliCity
- Read Thesis Weixiao


### 2 Questions
- Regarding ImpliCity
  - Geodelta really wants to measure using this mesh, what would be best explicit (you know some true locations right?) or implicit
  - How does this connect to the adaptive mesh refinement approach?
- Regarding Thesis Weixiao
  - This already has as starting point that we have a mesh, our goal is more to create one.
