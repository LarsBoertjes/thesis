7. Recap

### 1 Weekly Reflection
1. What did I do
- Initial Theoretical Framework
- Got hands on data Utrecht
- Initial SAM test on data Utrecht
- Review MVS theory
- Read papers on Geometric Entropy indicators, (Oblique) photo segmentation
2. What went well
3. What went bad
4. What's next?
- See planning for coming 2 weeks

### 2 Questions
- General feedback on theoretical framework
- Agree that final 3 steps are my major focus point of contribution? The rest is more or less implementation (See theoretical framework)
- I have been assigned the timeslot: 22/1/2025 10:45, does this work for you?
- Currently looking into the Point Cloud simplification literature, however it seems a bit irrelevant since it lowers the amount of points from an already established point cloud. And we want to create more points from a building level segmentation (?) So we rather need a KPI on the segmented building feature masks instead of on the point cloud.
- More for myself: Because SAM takes very long when segmenting the whole picture, maybe first find image locations and then only prompt there.

### 3 Planning for coming 2 weeks
Based on goal for next meeting: 
Have clear direction on how to do KPI/point allocation + improved simple reconstruction

- Wednesday 4/12: Work on segmenting obliques + 1 hour problem statement
- Thursday 5/12: Work on segmenting obliques + read papers as inspiration for how to get KPI/point allocation working + 1 hour problem statement
- Monday 9/12: Work on MVS on segmented obliques + read papers as inspiration for how to get KPI/point allocation working + 1 hour problem statement
- Tuesday 10/12: (sent intermediary results) Have simple reconstruction from SAM ready + first overview for KPI/point allocation + first version problem statement


- Wednesday 11/12: Work on simple reconstruction + improve/read on KPI/point allocation + 1 hour problem statement
- Thursday 12/12: Work on simple reconstruction + improve/read on KPI/point allocation
- Monday 16/12: Work on simple reconstruction + improve/read on KPI/point allocation + 1 hour problem statement
- Tuesday 17/12: Goal is to have clear direction on how to do KPI/point allocation + improvement on simple reconstruction from tuesday 10/12 + finished problem statement

### 4 Setting up Zotero Sync

### 5 Upcoming Deadlines
No official deadlines, but I have set the following for myself:
- Tuesday 10/12: Update supervisors on simple reconstruction from SAM + plan for KPI/point allocation + initial problem statement
- Tuesday 17/12: Present improved simple reconstruction + plan for KPI/point allocation + finished problem statement

### 6 Next Meeting
Tuesday 17/12 16:30

We have a company karting tournament from 15:30-17:30, could we meet before that?

### 7 Recap
- Agreed that main focus is on:
  - constructing KPI for geometric entropy on building level
  - adding extra points to complex areas based on KPI
  - defining a KPI to measure the final mesh quality and evaluate the effectiveness of point allocation in reconstruction

- Therefore removed sub-question:
  - How to link the segmented buildings across photos in order to create an initial 3D mesh? Because this is more implementation.
- And added subquestion:
  - How can a KPI be defined to measure the final mesh quality and evaluate the effectiveness of point allocation in reconstruction?

- Moved next meeting with Azarakhs to 17/12/2024 11:30-12:00
- P2 date has to be moved to 22/1/2025 from 13:00 onwards (Clara has been messaged)
